Jer 14:22 @ Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? 
art not thou he, O Lord our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things.&&
1 Sam 7 @ But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; 
for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.&&
